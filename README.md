# PDF-comment-collector
Ptyhon script to collect PDF comments from all PDF files within a folder structure

This is a script, which collects all comments from PDF files in a folder structure
and saves them in a text file.
It allows the user to search for key words within the comments
to find the correct PDF file in which this comment has been made.

Example: I know I've read this information somewhere in my sources and commented on it.
But where though/in which PDF?
This can help people who do not use a citation software and comment their PDFs.
